In this lab, we will be diving deeper into trees through red black trees.
The first part is pretty straightforward -> Implement the insert operation into red black trees

Details:
- All the functions have been declared in the header file which you MUST NOT change.
- Implementations for inorder and printRBT have been provided. 
- Implement the functions `insert` , `fixup` , `leftrotate` and `rightrotate`.
- Please handle the various cases as mentioned in the slides carefully.
- Remember to design your OWN testcases to test out the various possible cases.
- Keys will be distinct for insertion
Read the comments next to each function to understand what each function is supposed to do.
